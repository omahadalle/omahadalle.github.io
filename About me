About me


Hi! I'm Lukas, am PhD-student at the psychology department of the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Steven Scholte and Dr. Suzanne Oosterwijk. I’m interested in the neural representation of affective processes such as emotion experience and (facial) emotion perception.

Additionally, I’m a methods nerd, interested in novel analyses and statistical methods (for fMRI). Next to my research, I work at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging (location "Roeterseiland" at the UvA), where I provide technical assistance and develop software for automated data management and preprocessing. Throughout the years, I developed a passion for open and transparent (neuro)science, to which I aim to contribute by making my data publicly available and by working on various open-source projects aimed at improving methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

As part of my PhD, I also teach two courses on neuroimaging (Neuroimaging: BOLD fMRI and Neuroimaging: pattern analysis), in which I aim to teach students how to properly analyze and interpret fMRI data.

You can find more information about my research, software, data and teaching on this website. Also, check out my (very infrequently updated) blog. To be informed about new research, data, or software, it's probably best to follow me on twitter and/or Github.

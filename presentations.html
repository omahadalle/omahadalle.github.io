Phylogenetic Relationships of the Colubrid Snakes of the Genus Adelphicos in the Highlands of Middle America.
Nucleotide divergence estimates between the mtDNA haplotypes were determined.
findings of WOA II can help achieve a better human-ocean relationship.
the poorly knownChinese taimenH. bleekeriKimura;
Many authors consider Phalacroma to be synonymous with Dinophysis (Steidinger & Tangen 1996).
C. Cuesius and C. giganteus are closely related, and quite distinct from the other species .
low genetic divergence and barcode gap, suggestive of recent speciation.
The combination of phylogenetic relationships and local sympatry suggests a greater degree of species diversity for the genus than the..
Engraulicypris is confined to Lake Malawi . The partially sympatric distribution of the bariliine genera in Africa suggest a series of vicariance events , with the most derived genus , Raiamas , being the most widely distributed 
The sympatric distribution of the two populations favors species status , which we will maintain pending further study
It is most likely to be confused with L. malabaricus and to a lesser extent L. guilcheri, which have sympatric distributions. 
insights from phylogeny 
I also thank Dr., who patiently taught me the innumerable skills necessary to pursue my research. Without him I would undoubtedly still be trying to figure out which end of the pipette to hold.

to  answer taxonomic, phylogenetic,and evolutionary questions. 
Although Mortensen ( 1943 ) considered the two forms to be valid species , Mayr ( 1954 ) omitted L. pictus from his zoogeographical discussion of the genus because he thought it was possibly a synonym of L. anamesus 
The gaps between sympatric species are prima facie evidence that they are reproductively isolated.
The difference of the characters of these two kinds is simply the presence and absence of horns , but this difference is apparently so great that any one who gives a glance at the fruits might perhaps consider them as two distinct species.
Monophyly of the genus Cyprinella is supported by 38 characters. Species relationships based on 206 character transformations produced a fully resolved phylogeny of the genus. Within the genus, two major clades are recognized:
Phylogenetic analysis of pacific salmon ( genus Oncorhynchus ) based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data.
For my Master's dissertation I applied DNA analysis to construct and validate population databases for two separate populations of white-tailed deer that are commonly encountered in wildlife crimes in Canada.
As, further, the taxonomic literature of the genus contained several data — in part controversial — as to the occurrence of different species hybrids, this genus seemed to be a proper object for genetic investigation.
one species presently is recognized by systematists, should be considered specifically distinct remains a problem.
taxonomists have a challenging road ahead.
DNA has proved valuable in understanding the relationships among closely related species , subspecies , or even local populations.
For DNA barcoding, total DNA was extracted from muscle tissue preserved in 99.5% ethanol, using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification
from muscle tissue preserved in 99.5% ethanol.
I would like to request an extension of one day for all that is due today.

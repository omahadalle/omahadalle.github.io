Loading required package: usethis
For anyone else finding this issue by searching for the error; the explicit workaround is to manually install the glue package first:
install.packages("glue")
install.packages("usethis") # Now won't fail with error above
install.packages("devtools") # will hopefully work barring any problems with other dependencies

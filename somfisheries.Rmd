Synopsis of Somali Fisheries
Fisheries in Somalia

Introduction
Somalia is located in a highly productive upwelling area. Somali fishers use traditional fishing methods to catch coastal large pelagic fishes. Domestic fishey sector is poorly managed due to lack of effective fisheries policy. Indeed, the fisheries regulations are so outdated. increase demand for fishery products. one of the richest fishing grounds in the region Bigeye and Albacore tuna. The sector plays in terms of nutrition, income, employment and earning foreign exchange it plays a much bigger role in the economies of many coastal area. Although some portion of the handgear fishery is recreational, all giant tuna is sold, and therefore is also commercial.

Foreign Fishing
The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources (MFMR) issued 41 fishing licences to Foreign vessels to engage in fishing activities in the Somali EEZ without having a well defined plan to to monitoring , control and surveillance.
Currently Chinese are fishing in Somali EZZ using longline, purse seines and trawls. and sometimes operating within coastal waters. This increased conflict and competition for fish between the foreign fleets and local fisherfolks. Increased fishery overexploitation and habitat degradation by foreign commercial fishing are threatening Somalia's coastal and marine resources. In the western Indian Ocean, there is a growing China commercial fishery for tuna that operates both within and beyond the Somali Exclusive Economic Zone. cause particular concern within the domestic fishing industry in Somalia. which put domestic fishers direct competition with foreign fishing companies. 
Training Somali fishermen to use foreign technology. the regulations, and management measures needed to address problems in highly migratory species fisheries. The fishing pressure resulting from offshore fisheries is hard to estimate due to lack of data on size of foreign fleets and their annual.
These vessels may target either tropical (yellowfin and bigeye tuna) or subtropical (albacore tuna) species.

Three decades of illegal fishing: Challenges and Opportunities
Indentification of issues
1- To identify key issues to that contribute the current situation. 
2- Establish Somalia tuna policy that includes highly migratory species as tuna species, marlins, oceanic sharks, sailfishes and swordfish.
3- Establish unified national fisheries data collection. 
Lack of historical data and inefficient government spending
Somalia needs to develop improved gear and methods to increase catch, and establish TAC level for each fish stock.
IUU fishing in the Western Indian Ocean
Somalia should not license foreign commercial fishing companies. Offshore tuna fishing licences launched in late 2018. Current system of licensing lack transparency and accountability. illegal vessels just recently denied the right of Somali fishers in Puntland to fish for lobster off this coast. In the meantime Somalia can generate revenue from with enforcing strict license conditions. who have used the media as a tool to mislead public. This was done to prevent the public from learning of inadmissible evidence through media reports. Need to address new issues that arise. and the fishery is important to all 6 three wecoast states.

Fisheries management approach
Future approaches to manage the sector can be Ecosystem-based management and co-management but must be consulted dialogue, engagement, and collaboration with fisherfolks, as well as a range of diverse stakeholders.
ways in which seafood is caught, processed, distributed, marketed, retailed, and consumed in Somalia. and marketing commercially valuable species. 
The proposed legislation must protect the right of Somali fishers. community fisheries management. 
New Zealand now has a management system capable of protecting our fisheries resources against overfishing.
For coastal states like Somalia it is a 'give with one hand, take away with the other' situation. 
The purpose of the Act was to prevent overfishing , especially by foreign fleets , and to allow overfished stocks to recover.

Somalia participationin the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission is an intergovernmental organisation provides scientific information and management recommendations for stocks of yellowfin tuna develop quotas for HMS based on the total allowable catch (TAC) .
Quota Allocations is required.
Somalia has not been an active participant in IOTC due to lack of marine professionals and adequately trained personnel. 
IOTC has failed to take into account coastal state considerations, and, in many instances, has failed to successfully manage these species. IOTC has failed to take into account developing coastal state interests.
Extinctions of marine fish, unthinkable even a few years ago, now appear possible.  
According to Omar, the IOTC has ignored the warnings of the biologists and allowed overfishing of tuna.
All I ask is that the EU end'give with one hand, take away with the other' situation.
I am not certain it has ever been discussed.

## History of Somali fisheries ##
○ Somali coastal waters are one of the most resource rich fishing grounds in the world because of 
-the presence of a continental shelf and 
-the Somali current (draws the nutrient-rich water up from below) flowing the along the coast. 
○ Somali waters are an important breeding ground for many migratory fish species such as:
+ tunas and tuna-like species (migratory fish species)
+ other species such as sharks
+ other commercial species (reef fishes- Red snapper)

## Somalis and fishing ##
○ An Italian firm is attempting to establish a fish canning and fish meal factory here; as to the indigenous fishermen, a small start has been made by equipping a... 
○ Nevertheless, the Somalis are not traditionally fishermen, nor have they been consumers of fish.
○ Despite its 3,200km coastline, Somalia today has only a small fishing industry using traditional fishing methods.
○ Somalis on the whole are not great fish eaters even with the richness of their coastal waters.
○ Because of this, the country did not seriously engage in commercial fishing until the 1970s. 

## Employment ##
○ Fishing employs a small number of people in Somalia, mainly in the north.
○ About 12,000 persons engage in fishing, most of them for subsistence. (now 70,000). small-scale fisheries (SSF) 
○ A small fishing industry has begun in the north where tuna, shark, and other warm-water fish are caught.
○ Exports of fish, dried, salted or canned, do not exceed 1% of all exports in value.

## Commercial fishing era ##
○ Fisheries The development of commercial fishing dates back to 1974 when SomaliSoviet Joint Venture " SOMALFISH wis started.
○ The joint Somali - Soviet fishing company, set up in mid-1973.
○ The fishing industry is faced on an agreement with the Russians in which a joint Somali - Soviet fishing fleet operates each taking 50 per cent of the catch 
○ At the same time, improved distribution and marke ing facilities are being introduced – initially in Mogadishu ani later extended to other parts of the country. 
○ Further, the 1974 Co-operatives Law was also extended to fishing, and a joint Soviet / Somali firm (Somalifish), with ten Soviet trawlers, was created.
○ Fishing cooperatives were created in 1974.
○ The Swedes have provided vessels for shallow and deep water fishing and they have given training to Somali crews.
○ A policy to encourage private ownership of vessels and gear was introduced in 1983.
○ The fish canning plant at Alula has ceased operating.

## State Collapse ##
○ When the Somali government collapsed in 1991, there was a period when the waters off Somalia were illegally used as a ... 
○ Waste and dump it overboard, and then start fishing, taking home very large catches of illegally caught Somali fish.
○ After Somalia's collapse into civil war in 1991, some Somalis began to steal the odd small fishing boat.
○ But over time they attracted many European and Asian fishing vessels, whose exploitation depleted fish stocks. 
○ Longliners, -which are quite small, do fish illegally in Somali waters, especially in the months after October when monsoon winds draw ... 

++++>> What are the connections between IUU fishing and piracy in Somalia? 
○ Many pirates started as fishermen. As Ms. Petretto points out, Somalia's fishing waters used to be a source of community income. 
○ This practice reportedly has been going on in Somalia since the early 1990s (UNEP 2005,33).... 
○ In light of the estimated scale of IUU fishing in Somali waters, both in terms of 
-the number of vessels and 
-the size of the illegal catch,
○ These fishermen have violated the external sovereignty of Somalia by fishing its internationally recognised fishing zones.
○ Within 75 days of fishing, each ship gets up to 420 tons of fish out of Somali waters. The catch is worth 6.3 million U.S. dollars.
○ To stop illegal fishing, locals have begun to arm themselves and their boats and to keep watch on the coast. 
○ The Puntland administration began to issue its own fishing licences in January 2000 , having hired Bermuda - based security firm Hart
○ Licence sales continued to provide substantial hard currency revenues (issued by hogaamiye koxeed, oday dhaqameed, iyo mamulada qaar)

## Potential of the sector 
○ Somalia's maximum sustainable fish catch has been estimated at 180 , 000 tonnes/year of all varieties.
○ During the period 1989-93 the longline catch can be estimated to 6000 to 8000 t/ year in the Somali LME.  
○ Although the nutritional status of the refugees improved over the year as a result of better food supply, canned fish. 
○ Great potential contribution to economic 

## Challenges ## Challenges in the Fishing Industry ##
I will point out some of the outstanding challenges
complexity of the outstanding problems 
○ Lack of capacity amongst the ministries staff (wrong people is placed into position).
○ The condition of marine fisheries today (highlighting both marine ecosystems and marine life esp. fish species) 
○ Geographic areas that are under particular stress (Three dacdes of illegal fishing)
○ Primitive fishing technologies
== Lack of adequate and reliable data == (Estimation mainly)
○ Collection of this information would help with planning of fishery policies 

But many of the questions asked three and four decades ago remain unanswered; new problems have been identified.
These problems are more than thre decades old, and it is now clear that a “ business as usual strategy will not solve them.

 
 

 






you name it.

The destruction of the habitat of several fish species could threaten future catches.

## Fisheries sector development -the way forward- ##
Fisheries development strategies changed over the years, 
○ From simple ideas of modernising the production equipment (boats and gear) Somali fishermen would require nets, fishing lines, and boats.
o Complex programmes involving management and institution building. Fishery development has been mainly directed towards increasing fish production. 

Focus on the identifiable problems for the next decade.

○ Establish in the area of management information systems and statistical policy (Sudan lesson)
○ Innovative ways [relatively inexpensive methods and tools that have already been successfully applied in developing countries]
○ Identifying where improvements are possible
○ Building on the successful dimensions of what has been done so far
○ I would not say they have made absolutely no progress, but I agree that the progress so far has been disappointing.
○ Seafood production techniques.

Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976
○ legislation and regulations (includes lessons learned during civil war and lessons from other nations).
○ Employment and livelihood opportunities within the fishing community 
○ Pressure to find additional fisheries resources
○ Increasing numbers of part-time and seasonal fishers
○ Lack of management and enforcement

Reconciling the Interests of Government and need for hard currency revenues


This approach is called co-management
○ Process of community-based co-management from its beginning, throughimplementation, to turnover to the community.
○ Turkey - for the patrol support 





Examples of opportunities to bridge the gap between emergency relief and longer term developmental approaches

## Role of Int'l Orgs and NGOs
○ At the end of 1993 the ICRC started distributing fishing tackle for a further 55,000 families.
○ Int'l orgs is not engine riding but facilitate 
○ Build capacity and expertise even big egenccies 
○ What they miss in their task?

Almost certainly fishing illegally

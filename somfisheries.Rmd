Synopsis of Somali Fisheries
Fisheries in Somalia
Introduction
Somalia is located in a highly productive upwelling area. Somali fishers use traditional fishing methods to catch coastal large pelagic fishes. fishey sector is poorly managed due to lack of. Indeed, the fisheries regulations are so outdated.  
Foreign Fishing
The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources (MFMR) issued 41 fishing licences to Foreign vessels to engage in fishing activities in the Somali EEZ. 
Currently Chinese are fishing in Somali EZZ using longline, purse seines and trawls. and sometimes operating within coastal waters. This increased conflict and competition for fish between the foreign fleets and local fisherfolks. Increased fishery overexploitation and habitat degradation by foreign commercial fishing are threatening Somalia's coastal and marine resources. In the western Indian Ocean, there is a growing China commercial fishery for tuna that operates both within and beyond the Somali Exclusive Economic Zone.

Challenges and Opportunities
Somalia tuna policy
Lack of historical data 
Somalia needs to develop improved gear and methods to increase catch. and establish TAC level for each fish stock.
IUU fishing in the Western Indian Ocean
Somalia should not license foreign commercial fishing companies. Offshore tuna fishing licences launched in late 2018. Current system of licensing lack transparency and accountability. illegal vessels just recently denied the right of Somali fishers in Puntland to fish for lobster off this coast. In the meantime Somalia can generate revenue from with enforcing strict license conditions. 

Fisheries management approach
Future approaches to manage the sector can be Ecosystem-based management and co-management but 
ways in which seafood is caught, processed, distributed, marketed, retailed, and consumed in Somalia. and marketing commercially valuable species. 
The proposed legislation must protect the right of Somali fishers. 

For coastal states like Somalia it is a 'give with one hand, take away with the other' situation.

due to lack of marine professionals and adequately trained personnel. IOTC has failed to take into account coastal state considerations, and, in many instances, has failed to successfully manage these species.

I am a marine biology masters graduate student and very avid for fish and fisheries, but my passion applies to all creatures of the ocean. My research interests are in applied biology, ecology, conservation, and management of marine fishes.

I graduated from Red Sea University in Sudan with a BS in Marine Science in 2016. In 2017 I began my masters in Marine Biology at Silliman University. I expect to graduate by the end of 2020.

I am using R for data science.
